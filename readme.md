Webcam Instruments
==================

This is a simple openFrameworks project that uses OpenCV to create an instrument from the webcam. 

Created by [Tim Murray-Browne][1] for a [workshop][2] organised by London's [Music Hackspace][3] on 25 November 2012 on a Sound and Music Embedded Composer residency.
