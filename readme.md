Webcam Instruments
==================

This is a simple [openFrameworks][of] project that uses [OpenCV][cv] to create an instrument from the webcam. The interface and visuals are inspired by Memo Akten's [Webcam Piano 2.0][wp].

Created by [Tim Murray-Browne][tmb] for a [workshop][w] organised by London's [Music Hackspace][mhs] on 25 November 2012 on a Sound and Music Embedded Composer residency.

This software (excluding ofxGui.zip) is released under the Modified BSD Licence. ofxGui.zip is a part of openFrameworks which is released under the MIT Licence.
