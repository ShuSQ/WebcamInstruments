Webcam Instruments
==================

This is a simple [openFrameworks][of] project that uses [OpenCV][cv] to create an instrument from the webcam. The interface and visuals are inspired by Memo Akten's [Webcam Piano 2.0][wp]

Created by [Tim Murray-Browne][tmb] for a [workshop][w] organised by London's [Music Hackspace][mhs] on 25 November 2012 on a Sound and Music Embedded Composer residency.
